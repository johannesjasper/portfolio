Hey, 
I'm Johannes Jasper, a software engineer, bike enthusiast, coffee nerd, and home-brewer living in Hamburg.

I currently work at [WorkGenius](https://www.workgenius.com/en-us/){:target="_blank"}, where we are providing a fully automated platform for freelancers to earn their living.

Before that I helped [neXenio](https://www.nexenio.com/en){:target="_blank"} building [Bdrive](https://www.nexenio.com/en/bdrive){:target="_blank"}, an end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge file sync and sharing application.

My main interest as a developer lies in building scalable, well maintainable, and secure service-oriented applications. I currently focus on the lower levels of the stack. I basically work on anything from the API down: from event-based service architectures, the deployment pipeline, down to the infrastructure where I use AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. After targeting the JVM for multiple years using Java and Kotlin with Spring Boot I am now back at coding in Python.

I graduated from Hasso-Plattner-Institute where my focus shifted from human-computer interaction to deep learning and natural language processing.
In the course of my studies, I authored and contributed to the following publications:
