Hey, 
I'm Johannes Jasper, a software engineer, bike enthusiast, coffee nerd, and home-brewer from Berlin.

I currently work at [neXenio](https://www.nexenio.com/en), where I help building [Bdrive](https://www.nexenio.com/en/bdrive), an end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge file sync and sharing application.

My main interest as a developer lies in building scalable, well maintainable, and secure service-oriented applications. I currently focus on the lower levels of the stack. I basically work on anything from the API down: from event-based service architectures, the deployment pipeline, down to the infrastructure where I use Docker and Kubernetes. While I have my roots in Python and Ruby on Rails, I mainly target the JVM at the moment using Java and Kotlin with Spring Boot.

I graduated from Hasso-Plattner-Institute where my focus shifted from human-computer interaction to deep learning and natural language processing.
In the course of my studies, I authored and contributed to the following publications:
