Hey there, 
I'm Johannes Jasper, a software engineer, bike enthusiast and home-brewer from Berlin.




I currently work at [neXenio](https://www.nexenio.com/en), where I help building [Bdrive](https://www.nexenio.com/en/bdrive), an end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge file sync and sharing application.

My main interest as a developer lie in building scalable, well maintainable, and service-oriented applications. I consider myself "full-stack" in the sense that my focus reaches from the API, the service architecture with message brokers, the deployment pipeline, down to the infrastructure where I mainly use Docker and Kubernetes.
I currently mainly target the JVM using Java and Kotlin with Spring Boot.


I graduated from Hasso-Plattner-Institute where my focus shifted from human-computer interaction to deep learning and natural language processing.
In the course of my studies, I authored and contributed to the following publications:
